# lung_disease_classifier
My take on a model that can classify patients CT scans either as NORMAL, COVID19 or PNEUMONIA.
Model got ~93% accuracy. Iam looking to improve that, looks like the dataset was very unbalanced so I will generate some new data with data augumentation.

Also the code contains some of my personal notes so please dont mind them :)
