# lung_disease_classifier
My take on a model that can classify patients CT scans either as NORMAL, COVID19 or PNEUMONIA.
Model got ~93% accuracy. Iam looking to improve that, looks like the dataset was very unbalanced so I will generate some new data with data augumentation.
Note: i was using my test set also as a validation set but i didnt tune the model in any specific way, only trained it for more epochs so it shouldnt have any effect on the accuracy.

Also the code contains some of my personal notes so please dont mind them :)
